If a party is listed on a refinance order that does not appear on the FVD, then the name(s) must be run for liens and judgments like any other owner.</p>
					<p align="justify">In addition, all defects, liens, and encumbrances specifically referred to in the documents revealed in the search must be reported as exceptions, unless properly disposed of.
